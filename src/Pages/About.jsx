            ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m a Fullstack .NET student at Chas Academy with a passion
            for coding, problem-solving, and continuous learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started programming in 2023 through a Code Institute challenge and
            quickly fell in love with building apps and debugging complex
            issuesâ€”especially on Windows (without breaking anything!).
          </p>
          <p>
            Before tech, I worked as a Certified Prosthetist Orthotist, where I
            solved real-world problems, analyzed data, and collaborated with
            people dailyâ€”skills that now strengthen my work as a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since moving to Sweden, Iâ€™ve embraced new cultures, learned Swedish,
            and adapted fastâ€”traits that reflect my drive to grow in tech.
          </p>
